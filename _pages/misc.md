In my free time, I enjoy tennis, rock climbing, violin, and trying new restaurants.

## Tennis

I have been playing tennis since I was 8 years old. I was on my high school's Varsity tennis team for all four years. We won the Southern California state championship in my senior year. At UVA I am a part of UVA's Club Tennis Travel team. While I did not play on our national team, our team won the Club Tennis national championship in 2023.

## Rock Climbing

I started rock climbing during my internship in the Bay Area. In my peak I climbed v5, but I injured my finger and am still currently recovering.

## Violin

I have been playing Violin since I was 7 years old. I was a part of my high school's Chamber Orchestra, where we travelled to Switzerland and Austria to perform. At UVA I was a part of the Cavalier Symphony Orchestra, a fully student-run symphony orchestra.

## Restaurants

I log all of my new restaurant visits on Beli. Find me at @mandrewa or [https://beliapp.com/app/mandrewa](https://beliapp.com/app/mandrewa)
