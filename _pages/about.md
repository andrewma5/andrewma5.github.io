---

I am a computer science student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. For the past two years, I have conducted machine learning research on the UVA Floodwatch team, and I have been the Team Lead for the past year. Floodwatch is a smart-city Internet of Things platform for flood prediction. See floodwatch.io. Last summer, I was a software engineering internship at NimbleRx, a med-tech unicorn-stage startup. This upcoming summer, I will be a software engineering intern at Jane Street. Following my graduation from UVA, I will be pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University.

In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, rock climbing, and violin.
